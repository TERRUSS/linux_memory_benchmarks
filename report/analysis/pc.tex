This benchmarks measure the bandwidth of the DRAM loads, without CPU interferences by bypassing prefetchers thanks to a 'random pointer chasing' method.

As long as we benchmark the DRAM only, it makes sense that the result is not dependant on L* caches. However I don't explain why the L3's results are way higher than the others...
