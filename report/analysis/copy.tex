The result of the copy benchmark are very straightforward : the farther the memory used is from the precursor, the lower is the bandwidth. The measured values are for load and write in memory.\\

The blue bars represent the run where only the L1 cache is used, and the bandwith we measure is in average 70GiB/s for my processor.
The yellow bars shows a run where the L1 is filled and half of the L2 cache, the difference is striking : only 40GiB/s ; and on the last run, where we filed both L1, L2, and half of the L3 cache, we have 20GiB/s.\\


We notice a slight change in the L1 results : the bandwidth is a bit better when \cleanstyle{AVX} instructions are used (almost 20GiB/s). It may be the processor which preferes those instructions than \cleanstyle{SSE}. Anyway, we do not detect this change in the other runs where the others caches are involved.
