On this benchmark, the bandwidth measured is only for a load operation, and the values beetween runs are surprisingly very close - and low - when we use \cleanstyle{SSE} instructions.

On the other hand, when \cleanstyle{AVX} instructions are used, L1 cache is about twice more efficient, and a small gap between L2 and L3 bandwidth come up.\\

The L3 bandwidth seems fixed at 30GiB/s, independently of the benchmark variant.
