In this benchmark again, the most important result is that the more large the vector instruction is, the higher the bandwidth is, and so for all the caches used.

For instance, using \cleanstyle{SSE 128B} instead of \cleanstyle{SSE 16B} instructions triples the bandwidth, whatever the caches used.\\


Also, we can see that the \cleanstyle{AVX} instructions are much more effective than \cleanstyle{SSE} ones.

The improvement of "maximizing the length of the vector instructions" is here limited by the caches themselves. L2 and L3 caches reach their maximum bandwidth for the variations \cleanstyle{AVX 64B} to \cleanstyle{256B} around 50GiB/s.

The L1 cache show its bandwidth superiority, and continue rising to almost a 100GiB/s, thanks to the large vectors instructions.
