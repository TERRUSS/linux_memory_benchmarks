These results shows once again that L1 is faster than L2, which is faster than L3, this time for store operation only.
The results are less impressive than the load operations : the differences between the differences between the runs are more similar than for the load test.

An interesting point is here that the \cleanstyle{AVX} instructions are more effective than the \cleanstyle{SSE} ones ; and takes better benefits of the storing advantages of the different caches : the results for the L1 cache are far better than the others with \cleanstyle{AVX} instructions than they are with \cleanstyle{SSE}.
